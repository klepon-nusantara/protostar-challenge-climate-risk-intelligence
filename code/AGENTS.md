# Instructions for AI agents

This repository is a submission to the Protostar Challenge: Climate Risk Intelligence. Follow these rules in every task.

## Data rule (never break it)

- Forecasts are made as of 2018-12-31. Weather data used as a forecast input must be dated on or before 2018-12-31.
- Do not download, query or use weather observations dated 2019-01-01 or later, from any source (e.g., NOAA, Meteostat, Open-Meteo, ERA5, weather websites), nor 2019–2025 data driven by the weather (e.g., streamflow, air quality, energy demand).
- Set an end date of 2018-12-31 or earlier on every weather download.
- Never write `predicted_value` from memory or from a web search: every value must come from the code's model.
- If a task seems to need weather data after 2018, stop and ask a team member.
- Data that does not respond to the weather (e.g., census, land cover, elevation) may come from any year; record its source in `data/README.md`.

## Working rules

- Training data: `CMU-OSPO/protostar-climate-train-to-2018` (Hugging Face).
- Code goes in `code/`, curated data in `data/` (described in `data/README.md`).
- After changing `submission.csv`, run `python code/check_submission.py`.
- The code must reproduce `submission.csv` without an agent (scripts or notebooks that run top to bottom).
- Never write tokens or credentials into any file.
- Summarize what you did in the README's "AI Tools and Agents" section.
